### changelogs

* 07/22 rewrite the post in English, remove some outdated information.

# Summary

I got a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 5th Gen (X1C5) and running Arch Linux (4.11) on it.

Most stuff works out of box,

  * wifi
  * backlit keyboard
  * LEDs on keyboard (caps lock/mute/mic mute)
  * TrackPoint - slow speed but works.
  * TrackPad - not so precise but works.
  * Thunderbolt 3 - USB-C to HDMI / USB-C Hub works.
  * Bluetooth - works with a FC30 game controller.

I haven't tried,

  * WWAN
  * micro SD reader
  * mini-Ethernet - I don't have the adapter.
  * hibernation - I don't setup a swap partition.

# TrackPoint

X1C5 have two versions of TrackPoint: ALPS and Elantech[^trackpoint_versions].

I confirmed mine has an Elantech one using [TrackPointDetect.exe][trackpoint_util].

    Pst Vendor : Elan
    [ERROR]: This TrackPoint is Elan (ID:03)

[^trackpoint_versions]: <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9768231/>

## Problems

The trackpoint works out of box, but it got recognized as a "PS/2 Generic Mouse".
Since kernel driver doesn't support the new trackpoint, I can't adjust sensitivity and speed. The default speed/sensitivity is too slow to use.
I can get middle button scrolling works, but palm-detection won't work.

## Workaround

I found I can making libinput treat the "PS/2 Generic Mouse" as a trackpoint using a custom udev hwdb entry.

~~~~
evdev:name:PS/2 Generic Mouse:dmi:*svnLENOVO*:pvrThinkPadX1Carbon5th*
  ID_INPUT_POINTINGSTICK=1
~~~~

Also, there is a [patch][libinput-issue] which solves speed issue.

[libinput-issue]: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91369#c48

I get my trackpoint much usable by setting up:

  * `LIBINPUT_ATTR_TRACKPOINT_RANGE=10` in hwdb
  * `xinput set-prop "PS/2 Generic Mouse" "libinput Accel Speed" -0.25` in my .xinitrc


# New Hotkeys


Before linux-4.12, You needs [these][hotkey1] [patches][hotkey2] to get these buttons works.

# Fingerprint Reader

X1C5 have a Validity Sensor 138a:0097. There is no driver for it.

Furthermore,

  * [Validity90](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90) - an open source reverse engineered driver (WIP).
  * [a bug report of libfprint](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94536)
