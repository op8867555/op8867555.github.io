### changelogs

* 2018/02/11 add a note for recall experience and thunderbolt 3 failures.
* 2018/01/12 update info.
* 2017/08/22 update kernel to 4.12; add a WWAN section.
* 2017/07/22 rewrite the post in English, remove some outdated information.

# Quick Summary

I'm running Arch Linux (kernel 4.14) on a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 5th Gen (X1C5).

Most stuff works out of box,

  * wifi
  * backlit keyboard
  * LEDs on keyboard (caps lock/mute/mic mute)
  * TrackPoint - slow speed but works.
  * TrackPad - not so precise but works.
  * Thunderbolt 3 - USB-C to HDMI / USB-C Hub[^hub] works.
  * Bluetooth - works with a FC30 game controller.
  * WWAN - works with ModemManager.
  * mini-Ethernet - works.

[^hub]: I wrote a [blog post](/posts/2017-07-21-adam-usb-c-dock.html)
in Traditional Chinese ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ about the hub.

Things *not* working,

  * Fingerprint reader

I haven't tried,

  * micro SD reader
  * hibernation - I don't setup a swap partition.

# Hardware

## TrackPoint

### ALPS or Elantech?

X1C5 comes with two versions[^trackpoint_versions] of TrackPoint: ALPS and Elantech.
I confirmed mine has an Elantech one using [TrackPointDetect.exe][trackpoint_util].

    Command Line: "C:\Users\alexlu\Desktop\FW_Updater_1.0.0.9\TrackPointDetect.exe"
    OS: 64-bit
    Pst Vendor : Elan
    [ERROR]: This TrackPoint is Elan (ID:03)

### Cursor Speed & TrackPoint Cap

I took a plastic adapter[^plastic] from my previous laptop - a Thinkpad E130 and
trimmed a Soft Rim Cap to fit "Super Low Profile".
The cursor speed and acceleration gets much better.

![IMHO, a soft rim is *much better* than a soft dome.](https://i.imgur.com/cxoY1AOl.jpg)

## TrackPad


It works with libinput and pressure-based palm detection are functional.
But it is still unresponsive to small movements for current release.
^[<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98839>]

^[{-} There is a different device according to
 [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/6wimb8/doing_some_research_on_x1c5_touchpad_issues/).

`dmesg` output:

~~~~
rmi4_smbus 0-002c: registering SMbus-connected sensor
rmi4_f01 rmi4-00.fn01: found RMI device, manufacturer: Synaptics, product: TM3289-002, fw id: 2492434
~~~~

## Fingerprint Reader

X1C5 have a Validity Sensor 138a:0097. There is no driver for it.

There is an open source reverse engineered driver working in progress[^Validity90][^fp-bug].

[^Validity90]: <https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90>
[^fp-bug]: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94536>


## WWAN

X1C5 (WWAN) comes with a Sierra EM7455 LTE Modem (1199:9079).

It works out of box using latest ModemManager.

## Thunderbolt 3

### Firmware Failures

My X1C5's usb-c port dies sometime after I plug-in and out my usb-c hub, it was unable to charge and connect any devices, and it sometimes just "recovered" itself.
I initially guess it is a hardware failure and sent the laptop once to repair center, but the technician can't reproduce the issue.

Later I found there is a new [Thunderbolt 3 firmware update][tb3-fw], which says it:

  * Fixed an issue where system might not be charged after repeating AC plug-in and out.

It is not happen again after firmware updated so far. Intel WTF.

## Recall for loose screws

Lenovo recently(2018/02/06) recalls X1C5 made before 2017/11 and Mine is unfortunately affected.
I went to nearest Lenovo Service Center(around 4km) and it took 15~20 minutes for the technician to check. There is no loose screws at last.

# Software

I'm using i3-gaps without a desktop environment.

## Hardware Video Acceleration

It is possible to use the integrated graphic card to decode/encode videos,
and this helps power-saving a lot.

^[{-} See this [article][hw-accel] on ArchWiki for more info.]

There are two spec/implement/API: VAAPI (by Intel) and VDPAU (by Nvidia).
Since most software supports VAAPI, I just need to install `libva-intel-driver` pacakge.

## libva-intel-driver

Current release version has a bug[^vp9-bug] when decoding VP9 videos,
`libva-intel-driver-git` package should fixes that.

[^vp9-bug]: <https://github.com/01org/intel-vaapi-driver/issues/297>

[hw-accel]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration

## chromium-vaapi

There is a VAAPI implementation for Chromium OS,
and there is also a patch[^cr-vaapi-path] to enable that on Linux.
The `chromium-vaapi-bin` package on AUR provides prebuilt binary,
or you can build `chromium-vaapi` by yourself
(It takes about 6 hrs first time, you can use ccache to speed up if you want to build it more than one time).

[^cr-vaapi-path]: <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/532294>

# Outdated

These issues/tricks/workarounds are mostly outdated(linux kernel â‰¤ 4.12).
Maybe I should just remove this section someday...

## TrackPoint

### Issues

  * Recognized as a "PS/2 Generic Mouse"  
    â‡’ No palm-detection during trackpoint use

  * Since kernel driver doesn't support the new trackpoint, both of sensitivity and speed aren't adjustable.  
    â‡’ The default speed/sensitivity is too slow to use.

### Mark it as a pointing stick

I found I can making libinput treat the "PS/2 Generic Mouse" as a trackpoint using a custom udev hwdb entry.

*Note: this should not be used anymore once trackpoint gets kernel driver supports*

~~~~
evdev:name:PS/2 Generic Mouse:dmi:*svnLENOVO*:pvrThinkPadX1Carbon5th*
  ID_INPUT_POINTINGSTICK=1
~~~~

### Better TrackPoint Acceleration

There is a [patch][libinput-issue] which solves speed issue.

[libinput-issue]: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91369#c48

I get my trackpoint much usable by setting up:

  * `LIBINPUT_ATTR_TRACKPOINT_RANGE=10` in hwdb
  * `xinput set-prop "PS/2 Generic Mouse" "libinput Accel Speed" -0.25` in my .xinitrc


## TrackPad

The trackpad is <ins>able to</ins> use rmi4 over smbus for now(4.12).

Turn it on by creating a `psmouse.conf` in `/etc/modprobe.d/`

    options psmouse synaptics_intertouch=1

### Palm Detection

  * pressure-based palm-detection works great (libinput â‰¥ 1.8)
  * palm-detection during trackpoint use requires [mark it as a pointing stick][].

## New Hotkeys

Before linux-4.12, You needs [these][hotkey1] [patches][hotkey2] to get these buttons works.

[hotkey1]: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9596129/
[hotkey2]: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9596131/
